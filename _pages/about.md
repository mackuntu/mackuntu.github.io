            <h2 class="about-section-header">What I Do</h2>
            
            <p>At Dedrone, I oversee the development of AI-driven systems that provide comprehensive airspace security solutions. Our technology operates at the intersection of machine learning, real-time systems, and RF engineering to solve some of the most challenging problems in drone defense.</p>

            <p>I'm actively building world-class engineering teams across multiple disciplines:</p>

            <h2 class="about-section-header">Experience</h2>
            
            <p>My career has been focused on building technology that makes a tangible impact:</p>

            <div class="experience-item">
                <h4>Previous Experience</h4>
                <p>Before joining Dedrone, I held key leadership roles at major tech companies including Snap and Amazon, where I developed expertise in large-scale systems, product development, and team leadership.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="experience-item">
                <h4>Leadership Philosophy</h4>
                <p>I believe in creating environments where engineers can do their best work while solving problems that matter. Great technology comes from great teams, and great teams require clear vision, strong execution, and a culture that values both innovation and accountability.</p>

        <section class="about-section">
            <h2 class="about-section-header">Why This Work Matters</h2>
            
            <p>The challenges we're solving at Dedrone aren't just technical exercisesâ€”they're critical security problems with immediate, real-world impact. As unmanned aerial systems become more prevalent, the need for sophisticated detection and mitigation technology becomes increasingly important for protecting critical infrastructure, events, and public spaces.</p>

            <p>Our engineering work directly contributes to public safety and national security, making it some of the most meaningful and impactful technology development happening today.</p>
