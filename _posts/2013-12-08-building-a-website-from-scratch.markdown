title: Building a basic website, a collection of tutorials
category: posts
---

I have assembled a list of tutorials that I found extremely useful when building my own site. This list will be updated regularly as I come across new tutorials. Here they are, grouped by functionality:

### Source control
[Git, the simple guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide) There really is no way around the good programming practice of always using source control. It saves lives.

### Dynamic Web
[Ruby on Rails](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book)

### Blogging
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) This site is built using Jekyll
