My wife and I grew up during the only-child era of China, which means no siblings, and when it comes time for us to take care of our parents, two of us will need to support four parents, in addition to our own kids. 

My family is blue-collar, both my parents are hair dressers and earned their living humbly. They do ok for themselves, and raised me to the best financial circumstances possible, including putting me through one of the most expensive private colleges in the States. However, this means they don't have rainy day funds, trust funds or knowledge of long-term care insurances. My mother, who taught me the tenet of hard work and self-reliance, often tells me that when she gets older, she just wants to be sent to a nursing home. This hurts, because I also know it is unrealistic for me to be physically there with her at that time. Helping her with eating, dressing, transferring, toileting, etc. 

**While we don't typically think about our parents getting older, this process is irreversible and innevitable.**

Tackling this as I would anything else in life, I decided to plan for this foreseeable situation, and think through the scenarios and how I would keep controllable elements, well, under control. 

After a quick search on the web on this subject, I found that my situation isn't unique, but actually becoming a megatrend in most developed regions of the world. This is possibly due to people are living longer, while working to middle classes are being squeezed, and either not having kids or having less kids. The phenom is called the [Demographic Inversion](https://prospect.org/article/demographic-inversion./_) Judging by the UN world population projections, this megatrend will be in full swing in another 10 years. Solving dignity independence for seniors is therefore both an urgent challenge for my family, and a looming challenge for society at large.

To think about senior living, I chose to focus on Activities of Daily Living, or ADLs. This is defined as "The tasks of everyday life. Basic ADLs include eating, dressing, getting into or out of a bed or chair, taking a bath or shower, and using the toilet. Instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) are activities related to independent living and include preparing meals, managing money, shopping, doing housework, and using a telephone." [source](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/adl) Today, most of the ADLs are being done by nursing professionals, in both private institutions as well as one-off in-home visits. While this model works today, it will get increasingly expensive as younger labor becomes a precious commodity. 

"The national annual median cost of care now ranges from nearly $106,000 for a private room in a nursing home to $19,240 for adult day health care services (based on five days per week per year) according to the Cost of Care Survey 2020 by Genworth Financial. A semi-private room ran $7,756 a month, or $93,075 per year."[source](https://health.usnews.com/best-nursing-homes/articles/how-to-pay-for-nursing-home-costs#:~:text=The%20national%20annual%20median%20cost,month%2C%20or%20%2493%2C075%20per%20year.) This is the price range to match or beat for a technical solution. 

With this in mind, I now have a mission for the next decade: to create a robust system enabling dignity independence for seniors.
