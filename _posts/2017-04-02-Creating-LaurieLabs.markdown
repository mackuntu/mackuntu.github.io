As populations age globally, a critical challenge emerges: how do we provide 
quality care for our elderly while maintaining their dignity and independence? 
This question becomes increasingly urgent as demographic trends reshape society.

The traditional model of senior care relies heavily on human caregivers and 
institutional settings, but this approach faces mounting pressures. Many families 
struggle with the emotional and financial burden of long-term care decisions, 
often forced to choose between inadequate options.

**While we do not typically think about our parents getting older, this
process is irreversible and inevitable.**

This realization led me to approach aging care as I would any complex problem: 
by planning ahead, analyzing the scenarios, and identifying controllable elements 
that could be improved through technology and innovation.

This situation isn't unique to any one family, but rather represents a megatrend 
affecting most developed regions worldwide. People are living longer, while 
economic factors influence family size and structure. The result is called the
[Demographic Inversion](https://prospect.org/article/demographic-inversion./_).
According to the UN world population projections, by 2030, there will be
more 70-year-olds than there are 20-year-olds. Fewer young people available 
to provide care will create disparate ratios of care-workers to those
in need.

The challenge is to create a system which allows seniors to age
comfortably and gracefully, through assistive technology, while not
depending on substantial numbers of human care-workers. Such a system
provides Dignity and Independence to seniors. Building it is both an urgent
personal priority and a looming challenge for society at large.

To think about senior living, I chose to focus on Activities of Daily
Living, or ADLs. This is defined as "The tasks of everyday life. Basic
ADLs include eating, dressing, getting into or out of a bed or chair,
taking a bath or shower, and using the toilet. Instrumental activities
of daily living (IADL) are activities related to independent living and
include preparing meals, managing money, shopping, doing housework, and
using a telephone."[^1] Today, ADLs are performed for seniors by nursing
professionals, in both private institutions as well as one-off in-home
visits. In the future, all of these activities can be completed by
seniors themselves, through the assistance of AI and robotic systems.

"The national annual median cost of care now ranges from nearly
\$106,000 for a private room in a nursing home to \$19,240 for adult day
health care services (based on five days per week per year) according to
the Cost of Care Survey 2020 by Genworth Financial. A semi-private room
ran \$7,756 a month, or \$93,075 per year."[^2] This is the price range
to match or beat.

My mission with Dichotomy.ai is to create AI and robotic systems which
can aid seniors to achieve dignity and independence through technology-assisted
living solutions.
