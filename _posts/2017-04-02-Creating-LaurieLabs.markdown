My wife and I grew up during the only-child era of China, which means no siblings, and when it comes time for us to take care of our parents, two of us will need to support four parents, in addition to our own kids. 

My family is blue-collar, both my parents are hair dressers and earned their living humbly. They do ok for themselves, and raised me to the best financial circumstances possible, including putting me through one of the most expensive private colleges in the States. However, this means they don't have rainy day funds, trust funds or knowledge of long-term care insurances. My mother, who taught me the tenet of hard work and self-reliance, often tells me that when she gets older, she just wants to be sent to a nursing home. This hurts, because I also know it is unrealistic for me to be physically there with her at that time. Helping her with eating, dressing, transferring, toileting, etc. 

**While we don't typically think about our parents getting older, this process is irreversible and innevitable.**

Tackling this as I would anything else in life, I decided to plan for this foreseeable situation, and think through the scenarios and how I would keep controllable elements, well, under control. 

After a quick search on the web on this subject, I find that not only is my situation not unique, but is becoming a megatrend most developed regions of the world, where people are living longer, and total population is shrinking. The phenom is called the [Demographic Inversion](https://prospect.org/article/demographic-inversion./_) From the UN world population projections, we can see the timespan by when the effect of the megatrend will be in full swing. Solving dignity independence for the elderly will present main societal challenge.

Another relevant term to help frame this challenge facing seniors is called Activities of Daily Living, or ADLs. This is defined as "The tasks of everyday life. Basic ADLs include eating, dressing, getting into or out of a bed or chair, taking a bath or shower, and using the toilet. Instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) are activities related to independent living and include preparing meals, managing money, shopping, doing housework, and using a telephone."

With this in mind, I now have a mission in life for the next decade: to create a robust system, to allow for dignity independence for seniors.
