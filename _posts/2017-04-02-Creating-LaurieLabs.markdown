The whole point behind creating LaurieLabs was simple. I'm lazy, and I want robots to do more things for me.

Genesis was when I had to do a pile of dishes back when I was living in Beacon Hill. *"I need a maid"*, I remember thinking to myself.

But maids are expensive, easily $100 per trip, and I needed one almost everyday.

How do I get a maid, that will be able to clean around the clock, and yet not having to spend ~$3000/mo?

Of course, automation was the answer, but how? Computer vision / ML / Robotics were not really robust enough to the point where any commercial products were even ready to take on this ultimate AI dream. Or is it?
